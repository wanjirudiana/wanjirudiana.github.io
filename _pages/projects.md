🧰 Projects — Hands-on Cybersecurity & Cloud Labs

Here’s a collection of my completed and ongoing projects showcasing my technical experience in cybersecurity, cloud security, and Linux systems.

🔎 1. Network Scanning with Nmap

Tools: 🛠️ Nmap, Zenmap, tcpdump
Description:
Performed deep network scans to discover active hosts, open ports, running services, and OS fingerprints. Explored both TCP SYN, version, and aggressive scans to map network surfaces and identify potential vulnerabilities.
Skills Gained: Host discovery, port/service enumeration, interpreting scan results, responsible reconnaissance.
Status: ✅ Completed

🏠 2. Home SOC / Monitoring Lab Setup

Tools: 🧩 Security Onion, Zeek, Suricata, Splunk, ELK Stack
Description:
Designed a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab using virtual machines to simulate network monitoring and alerting. Configured tools for packet capture, intrusion detection, and log visualization to practice incident analysis.
Skills Gained: SIEM setup, log correlation, rule tuning, dashboarding, SOC workflow.
Status: ⚙️ Ongoing

🧭 3. Enumeration & Reconnaissance

Tools: 🕵️‍♀️ Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, WhatWeb, theHarvester
Description:
Conducted both passive and active reconnaissance to gather information about targets. Enumerated directories, identified technologies in use, and analyzed web server headers. Practiced ethical reconnaissance techniques in lab environments.
Skills Gained: OSINT, directory brute-forcing, service fingerprinting, vulnerability prioritization.
Status: ✅ Completed

☁️ 4. Cloud Computing Setups (AWS — IAM, S3, EC2, etc.)

Tools: 🌐 AWS Console, CLI, IAM, S3, EC2, CloudWatch
Description:
Created and secured a personal AWS cloud environment, applying best practices for identity and access management, storage security, and monitoring. Configured least privilege IAM roles, S3 policies, and EC2 instance security groups.
Skills Gained: Cloud security, IAM policies, S3 configuration, EC2 management, CLI automation.
Status: ✅ Completed

🐧 5. Linux Terminal Navigation & Administration

Tools: 💻 Ubuntu, Bash, systemctl, journalctl, grep, awk, crontab
Description:
Mastered daily administrative and troubleshooting tasks in Linux. Practiced navigating the filesystem, managing permissions, controlling processes, scheduling tasks, and writing basic shell scripts for automation.
Skills Gained: Command-line efficiency, file management, scripting, process control, permissions.
Status: ⚙️ Ongoing

🌐 6. Network Troubleshooting in Linux

Tools: 🧰 ip, netstat, ss, tcpdump, traceroute, nmcli
Description:
Performed hands-on troubleshooting for real-world Linux networking issues. Diagnosed IP conflicts, DNS errors, and firewall misconfigurations. Verified connectivity and routes through packet analysis and CLI tools.
Skills Gained: Network diagnostics, packet tracing, interface management, DNS resolution.
Status: ✅ Completed
