👋 Hi, I'm Diana Wanjiru

I’m a passionate Cybersecurity student at Meru University of Science and Technology, currently in my second year, and I aspire to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. My journey into cybersecurity began with a deep curiosity about how systems work and how to protect them from the growing landscape of digital threats.

Over time, I’ve developed strong technical and analytical skills in areas such as network security, incident response, Linux administration, and cloud computing. I’m particularly interested in threat analysis, SIEM tools, and vulnerability assessment, as they combine both investigative and technical problem-solving skills — two things I enjoy most.

🌍 Beyond Technology

When I’m not studying or doing cybersecurity labs, I love exploring tech communities, reading about digital transformation and cyber awareness, and mentoring peers interested in cybersecurity. I also enjoy creative design, personal growth content, and social media management — because storytelling and awareness are as important in security as technical skills.
